Gorilla Simulator

Gorilla Simulator is a 2D interactive simulation game built with Python and Pygame. Players watch an autonomous gorilla walk, interact with palm trees, and trigger unique easter egg animations, including a special Harambe sequence. The game showcases character animations, AI-driven movement, and environmental interactions.
